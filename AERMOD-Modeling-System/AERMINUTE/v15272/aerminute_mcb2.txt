                        AERMINUTE (dated 14237)

This Model Change Bulletin (MCB) documents changes made to the AERMINUTE 
1-minute ASOS wind data processor.  A brief description of the changes  
is provided below.Additional details are available in the FORTRAN source code 
and in the AERMINUTE user's guide.


This revised version of AERMINUTE (dated 14237) includes the following
modifications relative to the previous version (11325):

Modifications

1. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to adjust quality control flags 6 through 9.  
   Flags 6 through 9 were modified to account a change in the format of the 
   6405 1-minute data files roughly beginning with year 2014 files.  Flag 6 
   (2-minute wind direction) now checks columns 70-74, flag 7 (2-minute wind speed) 
   checks columns 76-79, flag 8(5-second gust direction) checks columns 82-84 and 
   flag 9 (5-second gust speed) checks for columns 87-89.  For these flags, 
   if there is a number in any of those columns, the respective flag is set to 0, 
   otherwise the flag is set to 1.  These changes allow AERMINUTE to work with pre 
   2014 and 2014 and new files.

2. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to create a new flag 10.  Flag 10 checks columns 
   64-68 for non-blank characters.  If a non-blank character is found flag 10 is set 
   to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.

3. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to create a new flag 11.  Flag 11 checks column 90 
   for a non-blank character.  If a non-blank character is found, flag 11 is set to 1, 
   otherwise it is set to 0.

4. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to make the previous versions of flags 10 and 11 to 
   12 and 13 respectively.

5. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to check for the number of fields in columns 67-90 
   if the record passes the strict quality control check, all flags are zero.  
   The number of fields should be four, representing 2-minute wind direction and 
   speed and 5-second gust direction and speed.  If the number of fields is not 
   equal to 4 then flag 12 is set 1 and flag 13 is set to the number of fields.  
   If the number of fields is equal to 4 then flag 12 is set to 0 and flag 13 is set to 9.

6. Modified subroutine CHECKWIND to increase size of variables aflag and iflag1 
   from 11 to 13

7. Modified module MAIN1 reset variable flagcounts from size 12 to 14.

8. Modified subroutine READONE, modified variable flagstr from size 12 to 14 and 
   included descriptions of modified flags 6-9 and new flags 10 and 11.  Also the 
   format statement for the counts of records was modified to left justify the 
   text and right justify the counts.

9. Modified subroutine READLINE to increase length of variable aflag from 11 to 13 
   to accommodate new flags.
