                            MCB#3                               3/27/97

                    STAR  (dated 97086)



      This Model Change Bulletin is formal notification of a change to the
STAR program.  The updated code is dated 97086 and is further identified by
MCB#3.  This version replaces all previous versions of STAR for regulatory
use.  Future changes to this program will be identified by an updated julian
date found on the first line of the model source code and followed by a
reference to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n) which will explain the
nature and contents of the changes. All Model Change Bulletins for this
program will always be available for back reference on this BBS.  In the
future, notification of changes (MCBs) to this model will be made in the
SCRAM ALERTS section of this BBS immediately following the LOGON procedure.

      This revision of STAR essentially modifies some variable declarations
      to allow the code to be compiled on more up-to-date compilers.
      The changes do not affect the operation or results of the
      program. If one has no need to recompile the program, there is no
      need to download this later version.  One other change corrects
      two comment statements.

1.    Change the following line of code:

      CHARACTER*4 STAB(6,2), DRCTN(17)                    STR02500

      to read:

      CHARACTER*4 STAB(6,2), DRCTN(17),MONTH,MP,MPR       STR02500


2.    Change the following lines of code:

      C                        LONGZ  = 3                 STR21500
      C                        VALLEY = 4                 STR21600

      to read:

      C                        LONGZ  = 2                 STR21500
      C                        VALLEY = 2                 STR21600

      This change makes these comments in the code compatible with the
      control record layout in the READ.ME file for this program. If the
      codes of "3" or "4" were used an error message would occur. This 
      corrects a typographical error made when the program was modified 
      several years ago.
                         

                           ******************

                           ******************
   
      New Model Change Bulletins will ONLY be issued when there is a change
to the source code for this program. Changes to test cases and/or any pre and
post processors that are included in the archived file for this program will
be addressed and appropriately identified in an amendment to the program's
latest MCB with notification posted in the SCRAM ALERTS section of the BBS.
