        INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE VISCREEN MODEL AND SPREADSHEET

The "Workbook for Plume Visual Impact Screening and Analysis", EPA report
number EPA-450/4-88-015, describes the use of a plume visual impact
prediction model called VISCREEN.  The model is designed to be run on an 
Windows-based personal computer and consists of the file named VISCREEN.EXE. 
Complete operating instructions for VISCREEN.EXE are found in the above
workbook and with other instructions.  (The file VISCREEN.FOR is the 
listing of the VISCREEN FORTRAN program source code.)

The VISCREEN model on SCRAM consists of the following packages and files:

	Model Code
	1) Viscreen.zip
	      VISCREEN.FOR - Viscreen source code
	      Viscreen.exe - Viscreen executable

              Results.xlms - Output file data results as
                             post-processed through an Excel spreadsheet
                             using Visual Basic macros

       Testcase
       5) Viscreen_Testcase.zip
	     TestCaseInstructions.pdf
	     TestCase.inp
	     Testcase.SUM        
	     Testcase.TST
	     Testcase.OUT

These five ZIP files should be downloaded to respective subdirectories 
under the main VISCREEN directory and then unzipped.  All five files with a 
"ZIP" extention can be unzipped (dearchived) using the unzip program 
available for downloading from the File Utilities menu of the TTN 
(http://www.epa.gov/ttn/tools.html) .  The unzip program "PKUNZIP.EXE" is 
DOS based and needs to be executed from a Command Prompt while WINZIP is a 
Windows based program that can be executed as a Windows Application.  

To run the Testcase, the VISCREEN executable needs to reside in the same
subdirectory as the test case data.  Additional instructions are providedd.
The user is encouraged to run the test case first, followed by the tutorial.
The user should become familiar with the technology in VISCREEN by reading 
the above workbook, viewing Vistutorial.pptx (also available in PDF format),
reading vistut.doc, and following the instructions in "VISCREEN Excel 
Instructions" before attempting to run VISCREEN.
