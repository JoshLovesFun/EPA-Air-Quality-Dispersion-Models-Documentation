     This Model Change Bulletin essentially initiates the
activities of the SCRAM BBS for this program.

     The WRPLOT program available from the SCRAM bulletin board
is a PC compatible version that generates wind rose statistics
and plots for selected meteorological stations for user-specified
date and time ranges.  Wind roses can be used to depict graphically
the dominant transport direction of the winds for an area.

     The WRPLOT program should not be confused with the WINDROSE
utility program also available on the SCRAM BBS.  WRPLOT was developed
primarily to produce graphic plots of wind rose statistics, whereas the
WINDROSE utility determines tables of wind frequency statistics but has
no graphics capability.

     This program will henceforth be identified by its name and
a julian date, i.e.: WRPLOT (dated 92087). Future changes to this
program will be identified by an updated julian date found on the
first line of the model source code and followed by a reference
to a SCRAM BBS Model Change Bulletin (MCB#n) which will explain
the nature and contents of the changes. All Model Change
Bulletins for this program will always be available for back
reference on this BBS. In the future, notification of changes
(MCBs) to this model will be made in the SCRAM ALERTS section
of this BBS immediately following the LOGON procedure.

                       ******************
   
     New Model Change Bulletins will ONLY be issued when there
is a change to the source code for this program. Changes to test
cases and/or any pre and post processors that are included in the
archived file for this program will be addressed and
appropriately identified in an amendment to the program's latest
MCB with notification posted in the SCRAM ALERTS section of the
BBS. 

     Questions or comments on the WRPLOT program should be directed
to Barry Gilbert, EPA-OAQPS, (919) 541-5238.
