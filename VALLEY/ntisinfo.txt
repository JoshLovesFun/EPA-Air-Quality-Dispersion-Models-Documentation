      Models are available, individually, from NTIS on microcomputer disks.
Regulatory and Air Quality models will also be available as a package.
Most of the disks must be transported (uploaded) to IBM 3090 machines;
however, some models do have PC executable code. Those that are operational
on IBM compatible microcomputers are identified as executables in the
following list:
